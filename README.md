The above link takes you to exactly where we got the csv file. However, it's extremely large with a lot of redundant data. 

Run the condense.cpp on that csv file and it'll create a "flightsv4.csv" file which is 1/10 of the original size of the csv file

Additionally, rename the csv file downloaded from the link to "flights.csv"
